## General info
I want to do some practice with C# and I find that I learn best while working on a project. I chose to make a discord bot as I thought it would be fun and it would be cool to be able to have it on my server for me and my friends to use when it is finished. With this bot, I would like to get it to a working state and have it respond to certain messages. At a push I would like it to be able to pull images from a web page. For example dog pics from google images.
